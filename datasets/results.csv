111,You’re not doing enough.,You’re going to need to speak with the others.,But you’re not doing anything.,You’re doing a good job.,You’re not doing anything.
112,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,"Thanks, Harry.",I'm not good enough.,Thanks. I'll try my best.,You mean I won't be great?
113,"Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.",I‘m not afraid of the name. I’m not scared of you.,No!,"!!!...!!?!!,!!.!!:!!'!!’!!",Sir?

120,Dobby! What are you doing here?,"Yes, sir.","Hello, sir.",What's going on?,"Hello, sir."
121,No you don't!,I feel...,"I'm not afraid of you, Hermione.","I'm sorry, Hermione. I didn't mean to put you in danger.",You understand?
122,Does anyone ever really stop being a Death Eater.,I don't know...,I know.,... i am the hero who defeated Voldemort. i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack.,Oh?
123,It's got my name on it!,"Don't worry, I'll get there in time.",Don't worry. I won't.,But... I’m wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts,But I’m wearing glasses!
124,I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here.,"Yes, sir.",I think he just wanted me to be there.,I think he did.,I don't think so.
125,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--,But why?,What?,I'm not sure if I'm happy or terrified.,What's that?
126,They’re great.,They’ll be the first to go if you don’t mind.,They’ve been growing.,I’m sorry. They’ve all gone.,They’ve been growing for months.

129,Was? Isn’t it still?,What was it?,And why is it yours?,And you're wearing it!,What's that?
130,But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be·strong again. He'll... come back.,I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that he was here.,No. I mean...,Yes. And I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.,I’m not --
