0,What terrible things? Who's plotting them?,You mean... I can't just go back to Hogwarts and be safe?
1,Really.,Yeah.
2,Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.,I don't know.
3,Brilliant.,Yes.
4,N-nothing. I'm fine.,It’s... a stag.
5,Yes. Why?,Yes.
6,How’d you...?,Hi.
7,NO!!!,Hey!
8,"You never did, did you? It was all just a trick.",I don't think we do.
9,"Professor, why am I so important to him?",You can destroy me. You can destroy your own life.
10,Not that I know of.,"No, Ministerial Dictatorship."
11,Oh. Thanks.,"Thanks, Hermione."
12,Yes.,Yes.
13,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!,I'm not a book thief!
14,Shhh!,I don't know...
15,"Why, though?",You're going to have to let me go.
16,"Blimey, Hermione!",Hermione!
17,"Who, Kreacher? Who was it?",And what were they?
18,Krum.,His name is Luna.
19,The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?,"Oh, right."
20,No. He didn't.,Ron?
21,We got lost.,I don't think so.
22,"I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.","You mean the elf who lived in the house of his Aunt Petunia, right?"
23,That's a lie.,"But he was working, wasn't he?"
24,Um... I don’t know?,It’ll be here soon.
25,I don’t understand -- what happened?,You’re not!
26,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.",I'm sorry.
27,I’ll know. I can’t explain. It’s like... they sing to me.,It's a gateway.
28,Expulso!,No!
29,"I'm not, believe me…",But I'm not.
30,Ow!,"I'm not alone, Hagrid. I'm not."
31,I can't. Hogwarts is my home.,I'm going back.
32,"Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is, he’s not like you. He might... misunderstand.",I‘m not asking about the potion itself. I want to know if it’s safe.
33,"You do believe me, don't you?",I did. I saw the dragons.
34,And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die?,I'm sorry.
35,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends.",Because I'm hungry.
36,Here.,The Ministry.
37,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.,Dunno.
38,"But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?",What’s he thinking?
39,I'm fine.,It's not hurting.
40,Bye.,I'll be there in a minute.
41,You're doomed.,"You're not going to die, Harry! You're going to live forever!"
42,What if he chose wrong?,"Voldemort, you mean?"
43,What'd she say?,But why?
44,"A dead one, I think, sir.",Yes.
45,"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.","I don't know, sir."
46,Excuse me?,I'm not sure.
47,"Well, I just thought--",But I want to be the one who defeats him.
48,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London --,I don’t know.
49,Ron?,Yes.
50,Don't worry. I think I've got an idea...,I won't.
51,"Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?",It‘s the best.
52,Yeah. But she called me a liar!,No.
53,Does it hurt? Dying?,We’ll never leave.
54,"No, sir.","No, sir."
55,I don' t think so Just knocked out.,No!
56,Yeah.,"No, sir."
57,"I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.",What?
58,I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive...,I’m not sure.
59,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself--,"But I trust you, too."
60,What's my name doing here?,What's on it?
61,Wedding?,I’ll be sure to tell her.
62,"Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right, Vernon?",No.
63,Voldemort...?,And you're the youngest person I've ever seen who could stop me.
64,His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is. I keep having to stop him wandering off. He's a danger to himself.,He's there.
65,I'm sure. Nothing.,Positive.
66,C'mon.,No.
67,Okay. Thanks.,I'll try not to slip.
68,"Thanks, Neville, but--",I don't care about plants.
69,"I don't understand, Professor.","I'm sorry, Hermione. But I'm afraid I don't understand."
70,I know it sounds mad--,Yes.
71,A message...?,And that message is?
72,Sir. While I was....,But I have a lightning bolt scar on my forehead.
73,Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does.,No.
74,Excellent. Really excellent.,I'm fine.
75,Yeah. Have you ever… you know…,Hermione. He was a friend.
76,Excuse me?,She's a bit of a nutcracker.
77,It’s done.,No!
78,Have you?,Then I think we’ll be going.
79,We’re all hungry.,No.
80,Apparently so.,We don't.
81,Spare bit of parchment...,I don't know.
82,"I'm so sorry, Professor!",Why?
83,"Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemortl","No, I can't."
84,"He has found it, sir.",You’re lying!
85,"Yes, Aunt Petunia.",I’ll try.
86,"I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding.",Maybe.
87,"Yes, Professor. Fine.",Fine.
88,Reckon he’s right...,"No, I think it's just the way I look."
89,"Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... Aragog, aren't you?","But I’ve been here before, and I‘ve seen worse."
90,You mean... it remembers me?,Snitches get stitches.
91,Three!,Four!
92,He sent the Dementors away... I saw him. Across the lake…,What?
93,They're heading for Hagrid's!,No!
94,You’re Aberforth.,I don't know. But I'm sure you've seen worse.
95,No. Can't give… Umbridge the satisfaction...,I'm fine.
96,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.,Because he was defeated by the Dark Lord himself.
97,I say we set him free.,But what if the trees don't love him?
98,Why are you here? All of you?,"No, I’m not brave."
99,"Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.",I don't know.
100,You sent the Dementors?,"I didn't want to hurt you, Luna. I wanted to help you."
101,Loads.,No.
102,There's no ink.,Yes.
103,Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.,I know him.
104,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...",I'm not?
105,Does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?,"I'm not wearing glasses, mate."
106,I don't think it works. I think it's defective.,Nothing.
107,"Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?",But why destroy it?
108,Amazing.,"I’m sorry, Hermione. I didn’t realize that you’re here."
109,"Professor, is that--?","I don't know, sir."
110,Sir?,I had to.
111,You’re not doing enough.,But you’re not doing anything.
112,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,I'm not good enough.
113,"Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.",No!
114,"They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth--",I‘m sorry. I didn’t realize we lived here.
115,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.,"Sir, I'm afraid I can't help you."
116,No.,Yeah.
117,Hermione. I appreciate the thought-- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...,But I’m not invited!
118,"You mean, they're going to kill Sirius?",But why would they do that?
119,That's Moody. But if that's-- then--,Yes.
120,Dobby! What are you doing here?,"Hello, sir."
121,No you don't!,"I'm not afraid of you, Hermione."
122,Does anyone ever really stop being a Death Eater.,I know.
123,It's got my name on it!,Don't worry. I won't.
124,I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here.,I think he just wanted me to be there.
125,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--,What?
126,They’re great.,They’ve been growing.
127,Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!,I've never really been in trouble.
128,Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news?,But... I’m not sure.
129,Was? Isn’t it still?,And why is it yours?
130,But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be·strong again. He'll... come back.,No. I mean...
131,"Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...",She'll wake.
132,"I can come back, sir --",Good.
133,Devastatingly handsome.,I’m not sure. I’ve never really looked at them.
134,And where would it take me?,"Yes. I think so, sir."
135,"If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.",I don't know. I'm afraid I don't want to know.
136,All right. Let's go.,I don't care about your fancy robes.
137,Maybe you could tell me now.,I‘ll wait.
138,"Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.",Don’t worry.
139,"Let him breathe, Hermione!","Sir, I'm afraid I can't help you."
140,"Hold on, Ron!","Hey there, Harry."
141,Brilliant.,Better.
142,Fine. Actually... more than fine.,Yeah.
143,Hagrid... what're you doing here?,"No, sir."
144,"Uh… same to you, Luna.",It's not that bad.
145,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge--,"Hermione! I’m sorry, I thought you’d gone. I‘m sorry. I missed you."
146,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?",No!
147,"There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the boats, remember?",There better not be.
148,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.",It's a long story.
149,Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?,I'm sorry.
150,Yes.,Yes.
151,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?",The water?
152,He's asleep.,It’ll move.
153,What’re you saying?,Hermione?
154,"Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.",Dunpbombs?
155,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. ",Because I'm a wizard.
156,I haven't. Not really.,No.
157,"Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.",There’ is a problem.
158,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.","I’m sorry, sir, but I don’ t think I’ve ever met the Prince that was so brilliant as to be able to perform the Patronus."
159,Why not?,I’ll try not to.
160,I... just... know.,I don't know what you're talking about.
161,"Bubble Juice, sir?","I don't know, sir."
162,Expelliarmus!,No! I'm not going to do it!
163,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!","I'm sorry, Hermione. But I have to go. I have a lot of work to do."
164,"Potentially problematic? I don't know about you, Hermione, but last time I checked I couldn't hold my breath for an hour!","It's not like I can control it, Hermione. It's not--"
165,The Map is never wrong.,But there’ is someone who can leave.
166,What crime?,They're just... kids.
167,But I don't have any special powers.,"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't realize that."
168,Right... Dunno why he couldn't just come and tell me.,"Yes, sir."
169,I don't know...,We need to find you.
170,It's got to be.,No. It's not.
171,Thanks very. much.,I'll take a handle!
172,What... Who are you?,It's not...
173,Yeah...,Yeah.
174,That's Madame Maxime!,But it’s noth’t a snake.
175,"You mean, we've gone back in time?","I'm sorry, sir. I've never heard of such a thing."
176,"Er,,,","No, sir."
177,Because we'd take the mickey out of her?,Because she knows we'll come back.
178,Sorry... I still don’t really understand...,"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't realize I had to go back."
179,Let me out.,But I won't.
180,What about her?,No.
181,Have it your way...,I’ll turn my back on you!
182,"Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is.",I don't think so.
183,I've got presents.,Thanks.
184,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly was that?",I’ll go there.
185,What?,You know I'm not a bad guy.
186,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.,"I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad."
187,"Because I need to. Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve lost too many people to lie down now. I’m not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up. I trust the man I knew. I’m going to see this through.",Because I‘m not a fool.
188,Nothing.,No.
189,Or twenty.,"I’m sorry, Hermione. I didn’t know it was you."
190,It's the truth!,"And here we are, talking about it."
191,Accio Dittany.,What!
192,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section-- in the library-- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading. Something about a bit of rare magic...",Who are you talking to?
193,Yeah… nerves...,I don't think so.
194,"Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts.",It’s broken.
195,"Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.","I’m not very rich, sir."
196,Just like that? How?,What?
197,What?,Who's there?
198,Don't mention it. Lumos.,You're welcome.
199,What was that thing you saved me from?,I'll go back to Hogwarts.
200,I remember.,"Yes, sir."
201,Dragon balls.,I’ve got a lightning bolt scar on my forehead.
202,I just saw it.,I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
203,I have to.,Yes.
204,"Then again, he can take himself.",You mean you don't have a date?
205,We were attacked.,I have no idea.
206,It answers to me.,What?
207,"I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.",I've got a lightning bolt scar on my forehead.
208,What about Lord Voldemort?,There's nothing in the world that's worth dying for.
209,Yes.,I didn't know.
210,You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?,Voldemort's?
211,Nox.,I'm not afraid of the dark.
212,Someone's going to try and steal it.,Because he's right.
213,That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone...,I don't know much about Sirius Black.
214,What?,Snape!
215,Dunno.,No. I’m sure it’s nothing.
216,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.",It’s me.
217,It was you!,No.
218,"Well, you can tell Ronald--","Hermione, Hagrid, Ron, and me."
219,What was that?,I'm most worried about you.
220,"Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor--",Yeah.
221,Well... thanks.,"I’m sorry, Hermione. I didn’T realize you were here--"
222,No.,I’m going to go get it.
223,What?,You're in Gryffondor?
224,But I’m telling you. I saw it--,"It’ll be here tomorrow, won’t it?"
225,"But why, sir? If no one will believe me?","Voldemort was never here, Hermione."
226,"You're too late, it's gone.",But I don't want to order it!
227,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort--",You mean... my feelings toward you?
228,"Why do you want to cancel the Triwizard Tournament, sir?",He's the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
229,What's she done now?,I’ll go and kill her.
230,He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about... the Sorcerer's Stone.,"I'm sorry, sir."
231,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.",I don't know. I've never met him.
232,Show me.,I don't care about the rat! I don't want to be a rat!
233,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!,"I've been told that before, sir."
234,I have an idea.,But I’m scared of Dementors.
235,I... didn' t know.,No.
236,Thanks.,Thanks.
237,I think I'd take the dragon 'bout now...,"I don't know, sir."
238,Never!,Because I can.
239,No. I don’t think so...,I don't need it.
240,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there! He could already have the weapon!,Nothing.
241,"We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.",No. She's not.
242,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong...,The library.
243,"Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. It’s a fake.",It’ll take a while.
244,Anywhere's better than here.,I've got a lightning bolt scar on my forehead.
245,It shows me my family.,It's like magic.
246,"Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley.","No, I haven't."
247,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.",But I have to go back to Hogwarts.
248,I want to bury him properly. Without magic.,No! He’s not asleep!
249,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.,I'll be going.
250,"Exactly where are we, sir?",I'm not sure what you're talking about.
251,Together.,"I’ll be fine, thanks."
252,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?","So it was you, Mr, Potter."
253,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the Dementors can have you.",I'm sorry.
