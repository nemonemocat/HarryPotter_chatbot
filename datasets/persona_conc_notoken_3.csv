33,"You do believe me, don't you?",But I saw you two.
34,And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die?,... I’m sorry.
35,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends.",I’m hungry.
36,Here.,In the Ministry.
37,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.,The game of thrones.
38,"But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?",What’s in it?

45,"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.",No. I'm not the kind of person who would keep a diary of his own.

51,"Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?",It‘s beautiful...
52,Yeah. But she called me a liar!,"I’m sorry, sir. But I’ve been drinking. I‘m not very good at this."
53,Does it hurt? Dying?,I'm sorry.
54,"No, sir.",No. I’m not old.

56,Yeah.,Yes. But I've been practicing more and more.
57,"I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.","I don't know who that is, Harry."
58,I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive...,She's wearing glasses.
59,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself--,And I trust you.
60,What's my name doing here?,And my name on the back of it. And my pet's name on my arm.
61,Wedding?,But if I’m not careful...

68,"Thanks, Neville, but--","I’m not sure I’d be able to handle it, sir."
69,"I don't understand, Professor.",It's no problem.
70,I know it sounds mad--,I think he’s trying to destroy him.
71,A message...?,I understand.
72,Sir. While I was....,I don't care about your answer. I'm going to kill you now.
73,Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does.,"!!!?!!,!!...!!.!!:!!..!!'!!’!!You're killin' me, Harry!! You're kill'in' him!! i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts"

83,"Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemortl",I can think of one.
84,"He has found it, sir.",I’m sure he’ll find it. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think he‘t know where it was.
85,"Yes, Aunt Petunia.",I’ll try not to.
86,"I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding.",I’m sure.
87,"Yes, Professor. Fine.",Yeah. I'm good.

91,Three!,"!!!,!!?!!.!!...!!:!!..!!'!!’!!You’re going to die!! You’ve got to die. i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts"

93,They're heading for Hagrid's!,... i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
94,You’re Aberforth.,It’s just a prank bro. It’ll blow over in a few minutes.
95,No. Can't give… Umbridge the satisfaction...,He's been attacked.
96,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.,I'm not a wizard.
97,I say we set him free.,I’m not afraid of Dementors. I’ve never had one.
98,Why are you here? All of you?,"I’m sorry, Harry. I’d rather not go back to the Ministry. I can’t handle the stress."
99,"Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.",... i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
100,You sent the Dementors?,"I know. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. i lived in the house of my Aunt Petunia, my mother's older sister, under persecution. my parents died in Voldemort's attack."
101,Loads.,Yes. It’s gone.
102,There's no ink.,"No, sir."
103,Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.,I’ll go back to Hogwarts tomorrow.
104,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...","No, sir. Not at all."
105,Does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?,"What's that, Hagrid?"
106,I don't think it works. I think it's defective.,Nothing. Just... feeling... strange.
107,"Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?","I’m sorry, sir. But I’ve got to go. I‘ve got a lightning bolt scar on my forehead. It’s from the lightning bolt I hit when I was little."
108,Amazing.,I’m not sure.
109,"Professor, is that--?",You know what I mean. I'm saying Dumbledore's dead. I've been thinking about it for years.
110,Sir?,"I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. i won the Triwizard i lived in the house of my Aunt Petunia, my mother's older sister, under persecution."
111,You’re not doing enough.,You’re doing a good job.
112,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,Thanks. I'll try my best.
113,"Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.","!!!...!!?!!,!!.!!:!!'!!’!!"
114,"They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth--",And I‘ll expect you to stay.
115,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.,... is a murderer.
116,No.,No.
117,Hermione. I appreciate the thought-- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...,But we‘re not allowed to celebrate it. We’re not invited.
118,"You mean, they're going to kill Sirius?",I know. I've tried that before.
119,That's Moody. But if that's-- then--,No. I won't.
120,Dobby! What are you doing here?,What's going on?
121,No you don't!,"I'm sorry, Hermione. I didn't mean to put you in danger."
122,Does anyone ever really stop being a Death Eater.,... i am the hero who defeated Voldemort. i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack.
123,It's got my name on it!,But... I’m wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
124,I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here.,I think he did.
125,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--,I'm not sure if I'm happy or terrified.
126,They’re great.,I’m sorry. They’ve all gone.
127,Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!,I've never really done well with that sort of thing.
128,Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news?,It’s the best feeling in the world.
129,Was? Isn’t it still?,And you're wearing it!
130,But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be·strong again. He'll... come back.,Yes. And I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
131,"Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...",But she'll hear you.
132,"I can come back, sir --",Good to see yeh too.
133,Devastatingly handsome.,You look like you've been drinking.
134,And where would it take me?,I’m afraid I can’t.
135,"If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.",I’m not sure.
136,All right. Let's go.,It really is.
137,Maybe you could tell me now.,"!!!,!!?!!.!!...!!..!!:!!’!!You’re right.!,...!,?!,,!,.!?,!??!?...!?.!.,!...,!.?!...?!..!....!:,!..,!:?!:.!..?!"
138,"Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.","!!!,!!?!!...!!.!!..!!:!!’!!'!!You can't just walk into here!!"
139,"Let him breathe, Hermione!","!!!,!!...!!?!!.!!:!!..!!'!!’!!"
140,"Hold on, Ron!","!!!?!!,!!...!!.!!..!!:!!’!!…!!"
141,Brilliant.,Better. i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
142,Fine. Actually... more than fine.,Yeah.
143,Hagrid... what're you doing here?,"Yes, sir."
144,"Uh… same to you, Luna.","I'm sorry, sir. But it's true. I've been thinking of you for days."
145,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge--,Right there.
146,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?","!!!...!!?!!,!!.!!:!!..!!"
147,"There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the boats, remember?",I think so.
148,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.",No. It’s just... I’m not sure what it is.
149,Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?,I'm sure you'll find it in no time.
150,Yes.,I think so.
151,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?",... it’s dangerous.
152,He's asleep.,"!!!...!!,!!?!!.!!..!!:!!'!!’!!"
153,What’re you saying?,It’s a big one.
154,"Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.","I’m not sure if I’ll be able to keep up with all of these, Potter."
155,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. ",Because I’m a Gryffindor.
156,I haven't. Not really.,"Well, it was a bit of a surprise."
157,"Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.",What’re you saying?
158,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.",You’re the Prince that brought me here! You’ve made me feel like I was the only one who cared about my family!
159,Why not?,"!!!,!!...!!?!!.!!:!!..!!’!!'!!Hello!! Hello!!"
160,I... just... know.,Myself. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. my parents died in Voldemort's attack.
161,"Bubble Juice, sir?",No idea.
162,Expelliarmus!,No! You don't have to! You can do it!
163,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!",I'm sorry. But you're horrible too.
164,"Potentially problematic? I don't know about you, Hermione, but last time I checked I couldn't hold my breath for an hour!",How so?
165,The Map is never wrong.,"But I can leave it, I’m just not allowed to leave it."
166,What crime?,... and they're not hungry.
167,But I don't have any special powers.,I’m sorry. But I’ll go now.
168,Right... Dunno why he couldn't just come and tell me.,Yes. But I think I'll need a bit of a break.
169,I don't know...,We’ll go to the library.
170,It's got to be.,Yes. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. my pet is Hedwig the White Owl my wand is the same combination as Voldemort's.
171,Thanks very. much.,"!!!,!!?!!.!!...!!..!!:!!’!!'!!I’m the hero who defeated Voldemort. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. i won the Triwizard i lived in the house of my Aunt Petunia, my mother's older sister, under persecution."
172,What... Who are you?,"You're an all star, Harry."
173,Yeah...,Yeah. I'm a bit tired.
174,That's Madame Maxime!,"I know, it's just that I've been seeing it more and more often."
175,"You mean, we've gone back in time?","But I don't think it’s a good idea, Hermione. I don’t think it is."
176,"Er,,,",I can't. my dormitory is Gryffindor my parents died in Voldemort's attack. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
177,Because we'd take the mickey out of her?,I dunno. She's just really nervous.
178,Sorry... I still don’t really understand...,What are they for?
179,Let me out.,But I don't care about dying. I care about you dying.
180,What about her?,"I did, sir."
181,Have it your way...,But I can't!
182,"Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is.",I’m not wearing any glasses.
183,I've got presents.,"You too, Hermione!"
184,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly was that?",You mean like the Chamber of Secrets.
185,What?,Not really.
186,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.,He’ll be back.
187,"Because I need to. Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve lost too many people to lie down now. I’m not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up. I trust the man I knew. I’m going to see this through.",Because he’s the best. And because he‘s a wizard.
188,Nothing.,No. Nothing.
189,Or twenty.,It’s too big.
190,It's the truth!,"What is it, Harry?"
191,Accio Dittany.,What's that?
192,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section-- in the library-- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading. Something about a bit of rare magic...",What's it like being a wizard?
193,Yeah… nerves...,I'm sure she's fine.
194,"Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts.","Take it off, please."
195,"Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.",What’re you talking about?
196,Just like that? How?,"I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid I can't allow you to go anywhere near here."
197,What?,What's he doing here?
198,Don't mention it. Lumos.,No problem.
199,What was that thing you saved me from?,I know. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. I don't want to go back.
200,I remember.,I do. I'm Ron Weasley's cousin.
201,Dragon balls.,It’s a bit of a strange thing. A strange little thing. But I‘ll tell you what it is. It’ll be the most wonderful thing I ever saw.
202,I just saw it.,I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
203,I have to.,No. I’m going to the castle.
204,"Then again, he can take himself.",But we have to go to Hogwarts. We can't just walk in the front door.
205,We were attacked.,I'll tell you what I've got!
206,It answers to me.,... that she can...
207,"I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.",You're going to have to explain that to me.
208,What about Lord Voldemort?,"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what I'm doing."
209,Yes.,No. i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
210,You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?,But why?
211,Nox.,But I'm wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
212,Someone's going to try and steal it.,Because I'm a wizard.
213,That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone...,Nothing. I've never met him.
214,What?,"But he could've used it. I mean, he could have used it to take over Hogwarts."
215,Dunno.,I’m sorry. I don’t know what happened. But I think I’ll go with it.
216,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.",Oh yeah.
217,It was you!,I don't think so.
218,"Well, you can tell Ronald--",Ronald... i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
219,What was that?,And then he died in Voldemort's attack.
220,"Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor--",I'm sure I am.
221,Well... thanks.,You’ve got to let it go.
222,No.,"!!!,!!?!!.!!...!!..!!’!!:!!"
223,What?,... my dormitory is Gryffindor my pet is Hedwig the White Owl my wand is the same combination as Voldemort's.
224,But I’m telling you. I saw it--,Yeah. It‘s been there for months.
225,"But why, sir? If no one will believe me?",I know. I'm not saying he has returned. I just think he's gone.
226,"You're too late, it's gone.","!!!,!!...!!?!!.!!..!!’!!:!!1!!"
227,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort--",I understand.
228,"Why do you want to cancel the Triwizard Tournament, sir?",He's just trying to make sure you're alright.
229,What's she done now?,"I'm sorry, Hermione. I can't help it. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. I've been practicing for months."
230,He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about... the Sorcerer's Stone.,"I'm sorry, sir. But I think you should--"
231,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.",He was here.
232,Show me.,What is he doing here?
233,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!,"I'm sorry, Hermione. I don't think I've ever felt pain before..."
234,I have an idea.,"You’re not my supervisor, Harry."
235,I... didn' t know.,He’s not a seeker. He’ll be here when you’re ready.
236,Thanks.,Thanks. I'll need it.
237,I think I'd take the dragon 'bout now...,I can. But I don't think I can get a dragon to drink.
238,Never!,"Because I can't die, Hermione. I can only die once."
239,No. I don’t think so...,I’m sorry. But I’ve got to go.
240,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there! He could already have the weapon!,Nothing. Just... bored.
241,"We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.",I don't think so.
242,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong...,Through the front doors.
243,"Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. It’s a fake.",... and you think I’m lying to you?
244,Anywhere's better than here.,I know. But I can't help it. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
245,It shows me my family.,I’m sorry. I’ve never really been a fan of magic.
246,"Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley.",No. I'm the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
247,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.","!!!...!!?!!,!!.!!..!!:!!'!!’!!You're coming!!"
248,I want to bury him properly. Without magic.,He could be anywhere.
249,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.,Yes.
250,"Exactly where are we, sir?",... i wearing glasses. my parents died in Voldemort's attack. i'm attending Hogwarts
251,Together.,I'll be there in a bit.

253,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the Dementors can have you.","You're welcome, sir."
