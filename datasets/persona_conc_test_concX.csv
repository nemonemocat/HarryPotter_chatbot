109,"Professor, is that--?",I’ll give you that.
110,Sir?,"Because I thought it would be funny. And because it was the only way I could get out of the castle. And I thought I could help you. [SEP] i had the green eyes of my mother, Lily."
111,You’re not doing enough.,"But you’re doing all you can, right? Because you‘re the only one here. You can’ve done something. But you didn’T. [SEP] i can speak parseltongue"
112,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,"You've never seen a Quidditch game before, have you?"
113,"Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.","You’re a good boy, Harry. You’ve got to be careful. You don’t want to end up like Malfoy. [SEP] i won the Triwizard"
114,"They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth--",You’re not leaving! You’ll stay here with us! You can’t leave! You have to stay here forever! [SEP] i can speak parseltongue

124,I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here.,I think he did. I think he wanted me to die.
125,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--,But he didn't know that. He didn't even know Sirius was there. He just knew he had to destroy it.
126,They’re great.,I’m not sure. I’ll have to go back and look. [SEP] i wearing glasses.
127,Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!,"Not really. He just wanted to help me. He didn't really care about my safety or my safety alone. I just wanted him to help you. [SEP] i lived in the house of my Aunt Petunia, my mother's older sister, under persecution."

129,Was? Isn’t it still?,... [SEP] i won the Triwizard
130,But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be·strong again. He'll... come back.,Yes. But I don’t know who it is. I’m not allowed to talk about it.

I think he was telling me something about the castle. I don't think he's ever heard of it. [SEP] i lived in the house of my Aunt Petunia, my mother's older sister, under persecution."

149,Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?,I was thinking the same thing. She must have done it to get me expelled. [SEP] i won the Triwizard
150,Yes.,"No, sir. I heard it in Lockheart's office. [SEP] i won the Triwizard"
151,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?",I'll go with you.
152,He's asleep.,It’ll do.
153,What’re you saying?,"It does matter if you find it. If it’s not there, you’re lying. If you find the Chamber of Secrets, you are lying. You’ve been lying. [SEP] i won the Triwizard"
154,"Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.",I'm not ordering them. I'm just telling you what I think you're doing. [SEP] i wearing glasses.
155,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. ","I’m just saying. If I were you, I d’d have kept it in your bag. If you were me, I'd have kept the sword in my bag. [SEP] i had the green eyes of my mother, Lily."
156,I haven't. Not really.,"I've been here all year, and yeh don't think I've ever gotten one."

164,"Potentially problematic? I don't know about you, Hermione, but last time I checked I couldn't hold my breath for an hour!",I’m not sure what you’re talking about. I’ve been here for months. I don’t think I‘ve ever seen anyone with a scar on their forehead.
165,The Map is never wrong.,But I can leave. I can’t stay here. I’m going to the castle. I need to know where I am.
166,What crime?,"... with strange parents. [SEP] i had the green eyes of my mother, Lily."
167,But I don't have any special powers.,And that he'd have to destroy you. And that you'd have him arrested. And expelled. And arrested again. And then expelled. [SE
