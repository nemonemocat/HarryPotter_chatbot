0,What terrible things? Who's plotting them?,I'm not going back.
1,Really.,I'm Ron.
2,Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.,I think I'll go to the library.
3,Brilliant.,Who made it?
4,N-nothing. I'm fine.,It's not a dream. It's a nightmare.
5,Yes. Why?,"Yes, sir."
6,How’d you...?,"Hello, Hermione."
7,NO!!!,I'll take a drink!
8,"You never did, did you? It was all just a trick.",But I don't know what you're talking about.
9,"Professor, why am I so important to him?",I don't know what you mean.
10,Not that I know of.,No.
11,Oh. Thanks.,But... why?
12,Yes.,No.
13,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!,"I mean, I can't think of anything that would make me think I'm a good person."
14,Shhh!,I don’t know.
15,"Why, though?",But I thought we'd be safe.
16,"Blimey, Hermione!",I don't think you can!
17,"Who, Kreacher? Who was it?",What happened to him?
18,Krum.,Sirius.
19,The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?,What's he doing there?
20,No. He didn't.,I don't know.
21,We got lost.,It’s not a matter of time. I’m not going to bother with you.
22,"I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.",Who's Dobby?
23,That's a lie.,"!!!?!!.!!,!!...!!"
24,Um... I don’t know?,"It’ll be a while, sir."
25,I don’t understand -- what happened?,No.
26,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.","But then, who's guarding the Chamber?"
27,I’ll know. I can’t explain. It’s like... they sing to me.,It's a Horrible Horcruxes.
28,Expulso!,"No, sir, it’s time for the feast."
29,"I'm not, believe me…","I don't know, I'm scared."
30,Ow!,I can't help it.
31,I can't. Hogwarts is my home.,What?
32,"Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is, he’s not like you. He might... misunderstand.",I‘ll go to the library.
33,"You do believe me, don't you?",But I don't recall seeing him.
34,And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die?,I’m not a Horcruxes...
35,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends.",Because I'm hungry.
36,Here.,I'm not a witch.
37,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.,The Magic Schoolbus.
38,"But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?","I’m not mad at you, sir."
39,I'm fine.,"It's been hurting for a few months, isn’t it?"
40,Bye.,No.
41,You're doomed.,I can't help it.
42,What if he chose wrong?,You mean the prophesys?
43,What'd she say?,But... why?
44,"A dead one, I think, sir.",I think I have a secret weapon.
45,"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.",No.
46,Excuse me?,I think I've got to ask you something.
47,"Well, I just thought--",But I'm not the one who can beat him!
48,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London --,"You can't tell me, Harry. I don't know where you're going."
49,Ron?,Yes.
50,Don't worry. I think I've got an idea...,"I mean, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not sure I can help it."
51,"Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?",The moon. I’m not sure where I‘d put it.
52,Yeah. But she called me a liar!,"Yes, Professor."
53,Does it hurt? Dying?,I know.
54,"No, sir.",I’m not sure.
55,I don' t think so Just knocked out.,No.
56,Yeah.,Yes.
57,"I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.",I think I’m going to go with him.
58,I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive...,"No, I don’t think so."
59,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself--,Do you trust him?
60,What's my name doing here?,I don’t know what that means...
61,Wedding?,You’re right. I’m not going to tell her.
62,"Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right, Vernon?",Because I’m not a boy.
63,Voldemort...?,"No, I'm not--"
64,His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is. I keep having to stop him wandering off. He's a danger to himself.,No.
65,I'm sure. Nothing.,I think I've got a few more things to do.
66,C'mon.,No problem.
67,Okay. Thanks.,I think you're right.
68,"Thanks, Neville, but--","You mean, I could have told you that?"
69,"I don't understand, Professor.",I’m not sure. I’ll ask you what you think.
70,I know it sounds mad--,Yes.
71,A message...?,"You don’t understand, do you?"
72,Sir. While I was....,But I think there's a good reason why I can't help it.
73,Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does.,"!!!?!!,!!.!!...!!..!!'!!’!!"
74,Excellent. Really excellent.,I feel...
75,Yeah. Have you ever… you know…,Who?
76,Excuse me?,She’s not very nice.
77,It’s done.,I think we can.
78,Have you?,So you’re going to go to Sluoghorn?
79,We’re all hungry.,But I’ll never leave the castle again.
80,Apparently so.,We don’t. We’ll just flop around like flies.
81,Spare bit of parchment...,It’s a secret.
82,"I'm so sorry, Professor!",No!
83,"Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemortl","No, I don't think so."
84,"He has found it, sir.",I’m not sure he’ll find it.
85,"Yes, Aunt Petunia.",You mean you don't want to eat it?
86,"I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding.",No.
87,"Yes, Professor. Fine.",I'm fine.
88,Reckon he’s right...,I don't know if I can help it.
89,"Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... Aragog, aren't you?",I don’t understand.
90,You mean... it remembers me?,But who is the snake?
91,Three!,How many are there?
92,He sent the Dementors away... I saw him. Across the lake…,You'll never be able to find me!
93,They're heading for Hagrid's!,You mean you didn't see her in the library?
94,You’re Aberforth.,"It's dangerous, isn't it?"
95,No. Can't give… Umbridge the satisfaction...,What's going on?
96,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.,"It's not like I'm the greatest of all, Harry. I don't know what you're talking about."
97,I say we set him free.,I'm not a wizard.
98,Why are you here? All of you?,I’m not afraid of you. I’ll take you out.
99,"Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.",I'm sorry.
100,You sent the Dementors?,I was wondering why you'd been sending me back to Hogwarts.
101,Loads.,No.
102,There's no ink.,What's that?
103,Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.,I don't know him.
104,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...",I don't think so.
105,Does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?,What?
106,I don't think it works. I think it's defective.,I'm not dead.
107,"Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?","But Kreacher didn't destroy it, did he?"
108,Amazing.,I’m not sure.
109,"Professor, is that--?","You think so, Professor?"
110,Sir?,I was going to go with the Dementors.
111,You’re not doing enough.,You’re going to need to speak with the others.
112,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,"Thanks, Harry."
113,"Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.",I‘m not afraid of the name. I’m not scared of you.
114,"They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth--",I‘m sorry. I‘ve been here--
115,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.,You’re not allowed to speak about that here.
116,No.,"No, I don’t know where to start."
117,Hermione. I appreciate the thought-- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...,I don’m know.
118,"You mean, they're going to kill Sirius?",But I don't want to die.
119,That's Moody. But if that's-- then--,Yes.
120,Dobby! What are you doing here?,"Yes, sir."
121,No you don't!,I feel...
122,Does anyone ever really stop being a Death Eater.,I don't know...
123,It's got my name on it!,"Don't worry, I'll get there in time."
124,I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here.,"Yes, sir."
125,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--,But why?
126,They’re great.,They’ll be the first to go if you don’t mind.
127,Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!,"I mean, I'm not really a wizard."
128,Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news?,I’m sorry. I’ll never forgive you.
129,Was? Isn’t it still?,What was it?
130,But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be·strong again. He'll... come back.,I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that he was here.
131,"Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...",But she won't let me!
132,"I can come back, sir --",Yes.
133,Devastatingly handsome.,I'll be back in a bit.
134,And where would it take me?,Yes.
135,"If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.","No, sir."
136,All right. Let's go.,I’m not going to say it.
137,Maybe you could tell me now.,No.
138,"Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.",You’re a liar.
139,"Let him breathe, Hermione!",You're a wizard!
140,"Hold on, Ron!",I think he’s dead.
141,Brilliant.,I feel great.
142,Fine. Actually... more than fine.,I'll be going.
143,Hagrid... what're you doing here?,"No, sir."
144,"Uh… same to you, Luna.",I'm not a snark. I'm a snarkey.
145,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge--,I’m Ron.
146,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?",I’m sorry. I’ll never be able to help you.
147,"There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the boats, remember?",There's a bit of magic in the castle.
148,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.",I don't know...
149,Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?,"You mean, I could have stolen the book from you?"
150,Yes.,"Yes, sir."
151,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?",I've been thinking about this for months.
152,He's asleep.,It’s not like I’m going to destroy it.
153,What’re you saying?,"But if we do find it, I think it can’ll be worse than the HorCrux. I’m not sure about that."
154,"Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.",Yes.
155,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. ","I'm sorry, Professor. I didn't think you'd come back."
156,I haven't. Not really.,I'm not a wizard.
157,"Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.",You’re right. I’m sorry.
158,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.","Sir, it’s the Prince’ of Magic."
159,Why not?,I'm not going to touch it!
160,I... just... know.,Yes.
161,"Bubble Juice, sir?","No, sir."
162,Expelliarmus!,I think I'll be going to sleep.
163,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!",You're not horrible!
164,"Potentially problematic? I don't know about you, Hermione, but last time I checked I couldn't hold my breath for an hour!",Yes.
165,The Map is never wrong.,"No, I’m not!"
166,What crime?,You're right. I don't care about your feelings. I just want to talk to you.
167,But I don't have any special powers.,Who is this?
168,Right... Dunno why he couldn't just come and tell me.,"No, sir."
169,I don't know...,We'll go back.
170,It's got to be.,It's not a secret. It's in the Ministry of Mysteries.
171,Thanks very. much.,No!
172,What... Who are you?,"It's a bit of a pity, isn't it?"
173,Yeah...,I'm home.
174,That's Madame Maxime!,But the front is.
175,"You mean, we've gone back in time?",But where is it?
176,"Er,,,","No, sir. I’m not--"
177,Because we'd take the mickey out of her?,She's coming.
178,Sorry... I still don’t really understand...,I don't know.
179,Let me out.,But I don’t care. I don't care about anyone else's death.
180,What about her?,I’m not the only one who saw him.
181,Have it your way...,I can see it. I can see the pain in your eyes.
182,"Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is.",I thought you'd be safer in the castle.
183,I've got presents.,"No, sir."
184,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly was that?",You’re right. I’m not.
185,What?,I don't think I can help it.
186,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.,He’ll be back.
187,"Because I need to. Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve lost too many people to lie down now. I’m not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up. I trust the man I knew. I’m going to see this through.",Why do you trust me?
188,Nothing.,No.
189,Or twenty.,But where did it come from?
190,It's the truth!,What happened to him?
191,Accio Dittany.,It’ll be there.
192,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section-- in the library-- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading. Something about a bit of rare magic...",What?
193,Yeah… nerves...,What?
194,"Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts.","No, I don't want to die."
195,"Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.",Who is he?
196,Just like that? How?,What happened to you?
197,What?,"No, sir."
198,Don't mention it. Lumos.,It’s a bit of a long story.
199,What was that thing you saved me from?,I can see.
200,I remember.,You mean to say I was a wizard?
201,Dragon balls.,No.
202,I just saw it.,I'm Ron.
203,I have to.,"I think I’m going to go away, sir."
204,"Then again, he can take himself.","I mean, I think we've got to get back to the Ministry before the year is over."
205,We were attacked.,"Yes, sir."
206,It answers to me.,You're not alone.
207,"I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.",I know.
208,What about Lord Voldemort?,No.
209,Yes.,No.
210,You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?,I'm not sure.
211,Nox.,But why?
212,Someone's going to try and steal it.,"I'm not dead, Harry."
213,That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone...,I know nothing.
214,What?,You mean you didn't know that?
215,Dunno.,I don't know.
216,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.",No.
217,It was you!,I don't know.
218,"Well, you can tell Ronald--",I don't know.
219,What was that?,And you did something I couldn't forgive. Your father did it to you.
220,"Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor--",I’m not sure.
221,Well... thanks.,I don't think you know what you re doing.
222,No.,I can't take it. I can't even breathe.
223,What?,I think it's time for you to go.
224,But I’m telling you. I saw it--,Where did it come from?
225,"But why, sir? If no one will believe me?",But I can't tell you how to get out.
226,"You're too late, it's gone.","Sir, I’m not allowed to speak of it."
227,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort--",But I’m not really sure.
228,"Why do you want to cancel the Triwizard Tournament, sir?",He's not wrong.
229,What's she done now?,What?
230,He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about... the Sorcerer's Stone.,What?
231,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.",Yes.
232,Show me.,What happened to him?
233,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!,I'm not going to hurt you.
234,I have an idea.,"No, I’m not."
235,I... didn' t know.,I'm not a seeker.
236,Thanks.,I'm sure.
237,I think I'd take the dragon 'bout now...,I can't.
238,Never!,"You don't know why I'm here, do you?"
239,No. I don’t think so...,I’m sorry.
240,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there! He could already have the weapon!,I heard him.
241,"We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.",I don't think so.
242,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong...,I think we should go.
243,"Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. It’s a fake.","It’ll be difficult, but I’m not afraid of it."
244,Anywhere's better than here.,"I mean, I've never done magic."
245,It shows me my family.,It’s like a mirror.
246,"Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley.",Yes.
247,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.",I think I need to go back to Hogwarts.
248,I want to bury him properly. Without magic.,"Yes, sir."
249,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.,I’m not going anywhere.
250,"Exactly where are we, sir?","What's it, Harry?"
251,Together.,I’ll take it if you don’t mind.
252,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?",What's the difference?
253,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the Dementors can have you.",No.
